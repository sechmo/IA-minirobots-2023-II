# Matrix Multiplication using Genetic Programming
Genetic programming lends itself to tasks traditionally described through mathematical and symbolic means, that is why matrix multiplication is an interesting problem to tackle with a a genetic simulation. 
There is already a 2x2 matrix multiplication example provided by MEPX under the multiple output symbolic regression category. We are going to take a look at it.

# Data

The multiplier, the multiplicand and the product are flattened as vectors for input, there are 10 training exaples and 2 test cases.

# Parameters
Most parameters were kept default, but it should be noted how the program is limited to only use basic numeric operations (+,-,*) and the problem is set up to be distributed over several subpopulations with a relatively big population size.

# Results 
The population usually convergest relatively fast, and what is more surprising is we can see how it arrives to a, although unordered, formula pretty close to the traditional formula for 2x2 matrix multiplication.

The error is probably caused by the use of small values and the limited amount of training examples

The simplified output program is:
```C++
//Generated by libmep version 2023.3.29.0-beta

#include <math.h>
#include <stdio.h>

void mepx(double *x /*inputs*/, double *outputs)
{
outputs[0] = x[1]*x[6]+x[0]*x[4];
outputs[1] = x[1]*x[7]+x[0]*x[5];
outputs[2] = x[1]*x[7]+x[5]-((x[0]*x[5])*((x[1]*x[7]+x[0]-x[1]+x[7]-x[4])*x[7]));
outputs[3] = (x[5]+x[1])*(x[7]*(x[5]+x[3]));

}

int main(void)
{

//example of utilization ...

  double x[8];
  x[0] = 0.000008;
  x[1] = 0.131538;
  x[2] = 0.755605;
  x[3] = 0.458650;
  x[4] = 0.532767;
  x[5] = 0.218959;
  x[6] = 0.047045;
  x[7] = 0.678865;

  double outputs[4];

  mepx(x, outputs);

  for (unsigned int i = 0; i < 4; i++)
    printf("%lf\n", outputs[i]);
  getchar();
}
```

# Conclusion
This examples show us how a genetic program can easily get really close to the answer to a not so trivial problem, and makes us think in which other fields or problems could these kind of algorithms be used
